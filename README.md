# vr-race-car-game

This was a personal hobby project and is written for Python on Raspberry Pi (it won't work on any other machines because the library Pi3d is only available for Raspberry Pi - at the time of the project)

2 nRF24 modules were used for communications between the Arduino and Raspberry Pi
The race car models used are included in the "RaceCar" file
